Hey there, this was a simple test what i did with javascript. It uses just one line of javascript, some buttons in html and an optional part in css. I would recommend this to anyone as a first project.

<h3 align="justify">
In this project we used 18 html buttons, each one with its value referring to the calculator. We also use onclick to send the value of the button to the only line of javascript we have. The only different button is the clear which just reloads the page.

Here we have the js function. It simply adds the amount received with the rest.
